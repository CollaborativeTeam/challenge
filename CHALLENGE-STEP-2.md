## CHALLENGE STEP 2

In this seconds step, the idea now is to start working with react state ```useState``` and arrays methods. So now the transactions view must have the following functionalities:

Add Transactions Button => this button must be outside the table
Remove Transaction Button => this button must be a column in the table

Take into account that now ```Transactions``` must be the initial state of the component state, and you must mutate this state in order to add or remove any transaction
